            <h1>Model Y</h1>
            <p>The Tesla Model Y is an electric compact crossover utility vehicle (CUV) by Tesla, Inc. Tesla unveiled it
                in March 2019,[2] started production at its Fremont plant in January 2020[3] and started deliveries on
                March 13, 2020.[4]

                It is the second vehicle based on the Model 3 sedan platform.[5] The Model Y shares an estimated 75% of
                its parts with the Tesla Model 3,[6] which includes a similar interior design and electric powertrain.
                Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity,[7][8][9] The Model Y
                fills a smaller and less expensive segment than the mid-sized Tesla Model X.[10]

                There were four planned powertrain configurations for the Model Y: Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive
                (RWD), Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, Long Range with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD), and Performance
                (with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive).[11][12] The Long Range AWD model and the Performance model are
                currently being delivered.[13] The Standard Range RWD configuration was initially canceled in July 2020,
                due to the range (230 miles EPA) being unacceptably low to Musk, but is now orderable (with 244 miles of
                EPA range).[14][15] As of February 3, 2021, the Long Range RWD appears to have been cancelled.[16]</p>
