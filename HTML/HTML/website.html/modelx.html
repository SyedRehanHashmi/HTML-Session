            <h1>Model X</h1>
            <p>Tesla Model X is a mid-size all-electric luxury crossover made by Tesla, Inc. The vehicle is notable
                in that it uses falcon-wing doors for passenger access.
                The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S. The Model X has an
                EPA size class as an SUV,[7] and shares ~30% of its content with the Model S, half of the originally
                planned ~60%, and weighs about 10 percent more. Both the Model X and Model S are being produced at the
                Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne,
                California on February 9, 2012.[11][12] First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015.[13]
                After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's best-selling
                plug-in cars.</p>
