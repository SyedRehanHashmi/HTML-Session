            <h1>Model 3 </h1>
            <p>The Model 3 is an electric fastback mid-size four-door sedan developed by Tesla.[7] The Model 3 Standard
                Range Plus version delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of 263 miles (423 km) and the Long Range
                versions deliver 353 miles (568 km).[8] According to Tesla, the Model 3 carries full self-driving
                hardware, with periodic software updates adding functionality.[9][10][11]

                Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the
                assembly line on July 7, 2017.[12][13][14] The official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars took
                place on July 28.[15]

                The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than some other models by Tesla. Since
                early 2020, the Model 3 is the world's best-selling electric car in history,[16] with more than 800,000
                units delivered through December 2020.[16][17] The Model 3 has been the world's top selling plug-in
                electric car (PEV) for three years running, from 2018 to 2020.[17][18][19] It has also been the
                best-selling PEV in the United States for three consecutive years, 2018 to 2020,[20][21][22] the top
                selling PEV in Europe in 2019,[23] and the best-selling PEV in China in 2020.[24] In 2020, Tesla
                produced over 450,000 of the Model 3/Y chassis automobiles.</p>
