        <dd><mark> HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</mark></dd>
        <dd>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
            displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
            scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for the appearance of the document.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
            other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets surround and provide
            information
            about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
            but use them to interpret the content of the page.

        <dt>Machine learning</dt>
        <dd>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and
            by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a
            model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without
            being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of
            applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is
            difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[3]

            A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making
            predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical
            optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining
            is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[5][6] In
            its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

        <dt>Artificial intelligence </dt>
        <dd>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural
            intelligence displayed by humans or animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of
            "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance
            of achieving its goals.[a] Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines
            that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem
            solving</dd>
